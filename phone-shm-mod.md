 * Malaysia & Thailand having BP & ECG enabled...
 * Luxembourg & Philippines both having privacy policy and terms of use but nothing obvious about BP or ECG...
 * more works on the icon to support shadows and so (and dropping static round icon)...
 * polishing to UI code (removing useless elements from elements) and seems BP & ECG ISO have their own container...
 * Added 2 Descriptions for BP & ECG (not sure where it will be visible till I patch and make it runnable):
  > Samsung Health Monitor Model Blood Pressure App is a mobile medical application operating on a compatible Samsung Galaxy phone and Samsung Galaxy Watch that can transfer the measurements to the app on the Galaxy phone, allowing the user to view blood pressure data and trends.
  > Samsung Health Monitor Model ECG App is a mobile medical application operating on a compatible Samsung Galaxy Watch (ECG-Tizen/WearOS) and Samsung Galaxy phone (ECG-Android). This app captures bioelectric signals from the user. It's used to measure ECG, and data can be transferred to the Samsung Galaxy phone, allowing users to store and share PDF data with healthcare professionals.
 * Samsung has an address in Thailand...
 * Malaysia language is English, they did not translate the app...


As for the functionality (Code), here is what I observed:
 * Message handler that was absent before, failed to sync to watch try again later (I think this is where the layout seems to spinning forever and after a restart, the app connects to the watch)...
 * New countries visible in CSCUtil, Macao (MO), Malaysia (MY), Thailand (TH), Philippines (PH), Norfolk Island (NF), Malta (MT), Luxembourg (LU)...

OK so, NF is checked as isAUModel (Australia), MO is checked alongside HK in a new method called isHongKongRegion (China), and TH has its own method isTHModel

Nothing about the PH or MT or LU but it is possible to say they got partial support if not fully...

what next:
 * they are changing font programmatically ("sec-roboto-light")...
 * BP and ECG results may look different as I spotted method fromHtml (used to add styling to text, such as color, bold, etc) in a TextView...
 * BP History Compare...? worth checking this one out <- this doesn't seem to be visual, this might be related to checking BP accuracy perhaps...
 * BP is heavily modified (Code gone poof lol and new code replacing it or nothing at all)
 * ECG is modified same as BP...
 * I don't think there is a significant change in the UI...
