# SHM MOD - Changelog

Just a repo to put Changelog on for the SHM MOD Companion to read from...

I Don't want to update the companion all the time just to update the Changelog...

## What's SHM MOD \*gasp\*...?

just kidding lol, well, it's a tool for BP & ECG for Samsung Watches, but this tool has restrictions such as region lock and works only on Samsung Devices, and for that, I found it to be unfair, health is important, this tool should be accessapble to everyone, it saves lives... Anyway, Install the MOD according to the Watch you own:
| Tizen (Active2 & Watch3 Only)  | WearOS (Watch4, Watch5 & Newer) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
