# Current Known Bugs:
 * Lockscreen when ECG is complete, this bug came with Samsung watch update (GVK* where star is a number, ex GVK7), it is an OS level bug as I have tried to lock the CPU and keep the app running but the lockscreen ignored the command and locked anyway...

Nothing else I am aware of...
